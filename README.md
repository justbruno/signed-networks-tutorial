# Mining signed networks: theory and applications
## The Web Conference 2020 tutorial

### Abstract
---
Signed networks transform the information encoded by conventional graphs by attaching either a positive or a negative sign to every edge. This subtle modification vastly enhances the modelling capabilities of graphs. For instance, in a social network, where edges might represent interactions between users, the sign may determine whether an exchange was friendly or hostile. However, the introduction of edge signs invalidates many established methods and results from the graph-mining toolbox, and thus, problem formulations and algorithmic techniques must be studied anew. In this tutorial we aim to provide an overview of the literature in mining signed networks. We will present the most important theoretical results since their inception to the present day, we will discuss some of the most common applications, and we will reflect on emerging applications and directions for future work.

### Outline
---
The tutorial will be divided into four sections: introduction, theory, problems & applications, and future directions.

1. Introduction
  * Definition of signed network
  * Motivation

Theory
Balance and status theory. Signs can be interpreted in different ways. They can for instance indicate friendship/enmity or admiration/disdain. These interpretations lead to balance and status theory, respectively. We will discuss basic concepts and present fundamental results.
Spectral theory. The spectral theory of signed graphs is fundamentally different to that of their unsigned counterparts. We will define the signed Laplacian and discuss its properties. We will introduce the concept of switching equivalence and its implications.

Problems and applications
Node ranking
Graph partitioning and clustering
Community detection and polarization in social media
Link and sign prediction
Dense subgraph discovery in signed networks
Graph embedding and representation learning
Recommendations in signed networks

Future directions
Research interest in signed networks has increased significantly over the last few years. We will discuss opportunities for further inquiry in the near future, covering some of the most compelling open problems and emerging applications.
